                <p class="lead">Welcome to our epidemic simulator created by Jack Liu and Victor Pham for HooHacks 2020.
                    Inspired by the recent global crisis around Covid-19, we wanted to create a tool to help people
                    understand how epidemics spread and what factors influence the final outcome. This simulation runs
                    based on the SIR epidemic model where the population is categorized as either susceptible, infected,
                    or removed. We modified this slightly to account for infected individuals who display no symptoms
                    (carriers) as well as those who have unfortunately succumbed to the disease.

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p class="lead">The simulation involves 6 communities with individuals represented as dots and the
                    quantity of each type of individual graphed over time. In the beginning, there is a single infected
                    individual and each person is moving randomly. For each successive frame of the simulation, there
                    are 5 algorithms that are performed to determine the next state:
                </p>
                <ul class="lead">
                    <li>
                        Transmission: For each susceptible individual within the transmission radius of an infected
                        individual, there is a chance to pass on the disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Travel: For each community, there is a chance that one individual in that community travels to
                        the center of another community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Movement: Initially, each individual wanders around randomly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recovery: Each infected individual has a chance to recover from the disease that increases based
                        on the length of time they had been infected. This is governed by the function (t*Recovery
                        factor/200)^3 where t is time spent infected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Death: Similarly, each infected individual also has a chance to succumb to the disease. The
                        function for death is (t*Lethality factor/200)^3 where t is time spent infected.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead">This loop continues until a certain critical number of infected individuals is detected
                    (does not include carriers). Once these thresholds are met, several changes to the previous
                    algorithms are implemented.
                </p>
                <ul class="lead">
                    <li>
                        Social Distancing: Social distancing changes the movement of individuals so that they attempt to
                        avoid others as much as possible. However, the number of individuals who practice social
                        distancing is influenced by the participation rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Travel Restrictions: Travel restrictions mean that there is no longer the chance of travel
                        between communities hopefully slowing down the spread of infection.

                <h2>Where you come in</h2>
                <p class="lead">The power of this simulation is that almost every parameter of the simulation is
                    variable. This means that you can use this simulation to investigate when is the best time to
                    implement travel restrictions, or what impacts a few individuals that do not participate in social
                    distancing has on the overall outcome. Try to experiment and see what factors have the greatest
                    impact on flattening the curve. The sliders control the values of each parameter and using the space
                    bar pauses the simulation while the "r" key resets it from the beginning.
